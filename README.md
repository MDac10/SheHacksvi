# Classii
Classii is a web extension designed to reduce the 96% average dropout rates of online courses by acting as a community, accountability tracker and organizational system.

### The Problem
Asynchronous online courses - a rapidly growing $8 billion market - are not nearly as an effective learning medium as they could be because students fail to progress very far in them. An MIT study found that the average dropout rate for these courses was 96%; that is, only 4 in 100 students are getting through their online courses. 70% of Udemy students make it less than 1/3 of the way through a course before quitting.

So, we sent out a survey with 22 respondents to dig deeper into the reason why students aren’t finishing their courses, and the three most common reasons were:
- “I lost motivation to progress further in the course”
- “I felt isolated taking the course on my own.”
- “The course did not take priority over other tasks in my to-do list”

With these causes in mind, we built Classii.

### The Solution
Classii is a web extension designed to reduce reported feelings of isolation, increase motivation, and make courses easier to keep up with.
